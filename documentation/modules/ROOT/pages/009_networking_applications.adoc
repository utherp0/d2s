== *Understanding Application Networking*

====
*What will you learn?*

This Module will go into depth around the mechanisms for Networking of Applications within OpenShift. This will cover the Services, which are bound to the Project, Routes, which provide the external traffic connectivity and inter-Application networking. It will also explain Network Policies which allow for fine-grain control of traffic to a Service.

The Module will include some practical examples of Networking using three distinct Services in the Project

After completing this Module you will understand the nature of the abstracted SDN and the Service endpoints, how to setup Routes and what capabilities inter-Application Networking provides for Developers
