== *Deploying an Application to OpenShift*

====
*What will you learn?*

This Module will introduce you to the concepts of *Applications* from the perspective of deploying them on OpenShift. 

This application already exists as a Docker Image; this Module will walk you through the steps to execute it as an Application. 

After completing the Module you will understand the concepts of an Application and how to instantiate one with OpenShift.
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned. If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.

[NOTE]
====
A *Project* is an OpenShift object that contains all of your Applications and other components in a compartmented way. +
As the owner/user of a Project you have 'Admin' rights to it, meaning you can create any of the OpenShift objects that you have the rights to create within it.
