== *Injecting Runtime Configuration into Applications*

====
*What will you learn?*

This Module will introduce you to the concepts of Config Maps and Environment Variables being injected into active Pods

This will highlight the functionality of changing Application behaviour without changing code and therefore the Image that is used for the Application. This allows for dependency injection to be used in Applications, and encourages the creation of Cloud Native behaviours.

After completing the Module you will understand how to create, manipulate and use Config Maps to inject runtime information into Applications in OpenShift
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.
