== *Configuring an OpenShift Application*

====
*What will you learn?*

This module will introduce you to the configuration options for the Applications running within OpenShift

This will highlight the components you can change and their effect

After completing the Module you will be able set various behaviours of the Application running in OpenShift, from the perspective of the way in which the Application is hosted
====

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it).

=== *Setting up the Application for the Module*

This Module will explain the mechanics of configuring an Application's behaviour while running in OpenShift.

[NOTE]
====
This Module is all about crafting the way in which the Application operates within OpenShift itself. OpenShift hosts the Application as a Pod containing one (or more)
running Containers; in this Module we will adjust the way in which OpenShift hosts the Application, not the actual Application behaviour. In Module 006 we will examine the ways
in which additional information can be provided to a running Application to effect the way in which it operates (using Config Maps and Environment Variables).
