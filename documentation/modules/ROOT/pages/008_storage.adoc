== *Adding Persistent Storage to Applications*

====
*What will you learn?*

The Module introduces the concepts of Persistent Storage, which gives Applications storage that exists and persists beyond the lifespan of the Pod running in OpenShift

This will demonstrate the concept, usecases and constructs used to create, manipulate and retain storage for Applications

After completing this Module you will understand the concepts of Persisted Storage with regard to Applications in OpenShift

=== *Pre-Requisites*

In order to undertake the Module you need to be logged onto the D2S cluster and have access to a Project. This Project is pre-created for you by the D2S Admins.

*Ensure the two textboxes at the top of this HTML Guide to the Module contain the D2S Cluster address and the Project you have been assigned.* If not use the 'Copy' button on the text below to get the Cluster address and add it to the Cluster textbox above (pressing *RETURN* after pasting it). Then add the Project name if it is not already there, again pressing *RETURN* after entering it into the field.

First we will setup an example Application to show the use of Persistent Volumes and Storage within OpenShift

This is how easy it is to write this stuff
